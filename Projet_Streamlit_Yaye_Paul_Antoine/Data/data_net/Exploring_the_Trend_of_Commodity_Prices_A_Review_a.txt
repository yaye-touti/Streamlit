Abstract: As the supply of commodities forms essential lifelines for modern society, commodity price
fluctuations can significantly impact the operation and sustainable development of macroeconomics,
production activities, and people’s security and well-being. The commodity trading market also plays
a pivotal role in the competition of the international industrial chain and the sustainable development
of the industry. The method of bibliometrics was used in this study to trace the development of
research on commodity prices, and statistical and co-citation analyses were conducted on selected
literature samples. It was found that the research hotspots in this field are concentrated on four
aspects: factors influencing commodity prices, the impact of price fluctuations on the macroeconomy,
forecasts of commodity prices, and the financialization of commodities. A current commodity price
research network centered on oil prices has formed. Future directions in this field, which developed
out of oil shock research 40 years ago, can further investigate the impact of factors and the responses
that can be made to emergencies on commodity prices, as well as continuing to develop better
methods of commodity price forecasting.

1. Introduction
Commodities, essential lifelines for modern society, include almost all primary material commodities used for production and consumption, such as energy, minerals, and
agricultural products. It is important to understand the driving factors for the fluctuations
of commodity prices and the impact of commodity price changes on the macroeconomy [1].
In consumer and producer countries, a large part of income and welfare depends on the
prices of these goods [2]. Commodity markets occasionally exhibit widespread mass booms
and busts. These events affect the ability of the poor and those countries in the developing
world to purchase basic necessities, such as food and energy, creating trade imbalance, and
in some cases, political turmoil. The effect of the “boom and bust” of commodity prices
resonates with ordinary people because trade imbalances and currency shocks that can
then arise affect social welfare [3], the operation of the national economy, and enterprise
production in a way that not all price surges do. Therefore, commodities price fluctuation
has received attention from all quarters.
In addition, commodity prices are more volatile than others [4]. With the gradually
deepening financialization of the commodity market, this greater fluctuation is obvious
and is well known to be extremely susceptible to large-scale emergencies, creating rapid
fluctuation. Starting from decade lows in the late 1990s, commodity prices continued to rise
for the next 10 years, and reached their peak in June 2008. After the financial crisis, it was

pushed to a record high by many countries’ economic stimulus. The price until 2011 was
twice as much as that in 1988. From the second half of 2006 to the first half of 2008, driven
by various factors, the prices of agricultural products on a global scale rose, triggering a
round of food crises that seriously impacted the welfare of the poor worldwide. Due to
the wide effects of COVID-19, the prices of metal products, such as steel and copper, fell
sharply and then increased rapidly in 2020, posing a serious threat to the production and
survival of downstream small- and medium-sized enterprises. In the long run, the trend of
increasing volatility in commodity prices can be difficult to reverse, creating the necessity
to pay more attention to the field of forecasting international commodity prices.
More importantly, the volatility of commodity prices has an important impact on the
sustainable development of a country. Take energy as an example. Among the Sustainable
Development Goals, SDG7 is the Sustainable Development Goal of Energy, which is to
ensure that everyone has access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy.
However, energy prices affect the stability and sustainable development of most countries,
especially poor countries, where access to energy is limited; in addition, some populations
have no access to energy at all, which goes against the goals of SDG7 [5]. On the other
hand, sharp fluctuations in energy prices have had a significant impact, with rapid price
declines not conducive to energy exporting countries; however, sharp price increases
are unfavorable for energy importing countries, and exporting countries are affected by
energy price vulnerability [6]. If the general trend of energy prices cannot be well grasped
and a safe energy guarantee mechanism cannot be established, it will bring challenges
to the sustainable development of the country [7,8]. Likewise, food sustainability is one
of the main concepts for achieving global sustainable development [9]. SDG2 means
ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable
agriculture. High food prices will limit people’s ability to obtain food [10], which is
fundamentally detrimental to the long-term development of the country.
Having a better understanding of the research history and development path of
commodity prices, and grasping the current research hotspots and future development
trends, are of theoretical and practical significance. In particular, it can help companies
to prevent future business risks, help companies to take effective measures to hedge
the cost risks caused by drastic price changes, and increase the expectations for future
sustainable development. However, current research reviews in this field mainly use
qualitative analysis methods, relying on an author’s subjective framework to sort out
research themes and content [11], or only focusing on one specified commodity. For
example, Chiroma et al. [12] reviewed the application of existing computer intelligence
algorithms in crude oil price prediction, and analyzed the advantages and limitations of the
research. Ederington et al. [13] reviewed the existing research on the relationship between
crude oil prices and petroleum product prices, and summarized the causal and asymmetric
relationship between the two. Abdallah et al. [14] used food safety, price fluctuations, and
price transmission as keywords to quantitatively analyze literature on food safety and food
prices; this revealed the current research hotspots and status quo.
Compared with traditional qualitative literature reviews, bibliometric analysis, using
statistical methods, can evaluate and review research progress in a more comprehensive
and objective way, and is visualized. Therefore, this paper uses the Citespace software to
sort out the development of the field of “commodity prices”, grasp the overall growth trend
of the number of documents and citations in this field, figure out the top scientific research
institutions, countries and core authors, as well as their cooperation relationships. At the
same time, through co-citation analysis, we can understand current research hotspots and
dynamic evolution to clarify future research trends.

In addition, we can observe the cooperative relationship between institutions (Figure 6).
The current research basically forms a cooperative network centered on the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Hunan University, and Montpellier Business School. The Chinese
Academy of Sciences has a close cooperative relationship with the University of Chinese
Academy of Sciences, as well as with Xiamen University and Beihang University. Hunan University cooperates with the Beijing Institute of Technology and other institutions,
and this forms a sub-network. In other regions, the cooperation network centered on
Montpellier Business School and on the University of Pretoria has also strengthened. This

the stock market, etc. Hammoudeh is a professor of Economics and International Business
at Drexel University. He is well-known for his oil, gold, and financial market research.
Gupta is a professor at the University of Pretoria in the Department of Economics, who has
a certain degree of mathematical background and prefers the econometric research of time
series. Therefore, in the field of commodity price research, he is mainly data-driven and
focuses on crude oil price prediction. The three scholars all pay attention to the research on
commodity prices; however, their research focuses and methods have different emphases,
forming a complementary and stable cooperation network.
Wang is a distinguished researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yu is a
Professor at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, and Tang is a Professor at the
Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Both Yu and Tang are Wang’s students.
Therefore, the three scholars have a closer cooperation relationship and a single research
direction compared with the above cooperation network. Wang and Yu first proposed
the EMD method to decompose crude oil prices and focused on the prediction of crude
oil prices.
Overall, the research on commodity prices has experienced a boom period, attracting interest from many scholars interested in this research field, especially in exploring
crude oil price trends. Scholars represented by Wang, Tiwari, Hammoudeh, and Gupta
have produced a batch of high-quality documents and have gradually formed a stable
network of cooperative relations. Regarding the research content, the overall difference
between Eastern and Western scholars is not large, and the key lies in scholars’ academic
backgrounds and research interests.
4. Co-Citation Analysis of Commodity Prices
4.1. Cluster Analysis of Co-Cited Articles
If two articles appear together in the reference list of the third citing document, these
two references form a co-citation relationship. If the two documents are cited by n documents together, the number of co-citations is n times. According to co-citation analysis,
the degree of correlation between documents can be measured, and the collection of documents can be classified according to the degree of correlation, after which a cluster analysis
network diagram of professional papers in that discipline can be generated. In Figure 8,
showing the co-citation network of sample articles, node size in the graph indicates the
frequency of citations. The higher the frequency of citations, the larger the nodes. The
connection between two nodes designates these two documents have been cited together.
Indicating a change in the research direction, the color of the infographic changed from dark
to light over the 1990 to 2020 period, and the research focus expanded from an agricultural
commodity price and oil price dynamic to an oil price prediction and financialization.
In Table 4, which depicts a summary of each cluster’s details, cluster size represents
the number of articles it includes. Silhouette is a parameter proposed by Kaufman and
Rousseeuw in 1990 to evaluate the effect of clustering through network homogeneity [19].
The Silhouette value lies between 0–1, and the closer it is to 1, the higher the homogeneity
of the network and the higher the credibility of clustering. The publication year is the
average publication time of articles in this cluster. According to Table 4, the largest clusters
are Cluster #0, #1, #2, #3, and #4. Their articles focus on the exploration of the correlation
between commodity prices and the stock market, the exchange rate, oil price uncertainty,
and crude oil price forecasting. In addition, most clusters’ Silhouette values are above 0.7,
indicating that these clusters are highly homogeneous and highly reliable.

by many scholars. The contradiction between supply–demand and inventory change are
generally considered the basic factors affecting international commodity price fluctuations.
Since the operation of the global economy is fundamental to commodity supply and
demand, but financial markets can have a spillover effect into the commodity market, the
coordinated change of commodity prices becomes a goalpost for planners. Speculative
factors have pushed up the prices of major commodities in the past, making the strong
demand from emerging economies another reason for the overall rise in commodity prices.
Factors including natural disasters, cyclical changes in production, and policy adjustments
also considerably impact commodity prices. Differences in national economic systems also
lead to differences in commodity prices between countries. The economic system affects
the speed and strength of the transmission of international commodity prices to domestic
commodity prices, and ultimately reflects in domestic prices.

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9536

A substantial increase or decrease in commodity prices frequently results from a
combination of multiple factors. Hamilton [20] studied some factors leading to changes
in crude oil prices, including supply and demand, commodity speculation, monopolistic
oligarchs, and resource depletion. Mueller et al. [21], analyzing the reasons why food prices
doubled in the world from March 2007 to March 2008, found multiple factors, including
greater energy and fertilizer costs, increased financial speculation in commodity markets,
export restrictions, dollar depreciation, biofuel production increase, poor harvests, reduced
world food reserves, increased foreign exchange reserves, and the continuing increase in
world population and expectations of affluence.
Academic circles have continuously analyzed the factors affecting commodity price
fluctuations. Ranging from the basics of supply and demand to the impact of financial
speculation and analysis of interruptive events, and from linear to nonlinear, the research
in these directions continues to deepen comprehensively [22–29].
(2)

The impact of commodity price fluctuations on macro economy (Cluster #3, #4, #5, #6)

The impact of commodity price fluctuations on the macroeconomy is another noteworthy research direction that has developed to a great extent.
Building on the foundational work of Hamilton [30] four decades ago, scholars have
segued to study the oil price–economic growth relationship [31–34] or taken up nonlinear
perspective considerations [35–37]. Important in international trade, the relationship
between commodity prices and exchange rates has also received key attention. Chen [38]
used monthly panel data from G7 countries to study the long-term relationship between
oil prices and real exchange rates, and found that a co-integration relationship between
them and oil prices can better predict exchange rate trends. Other literature uses models
such as the vector autoregressive model (VAR) and generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity model (GARCH) to select different countries as research objects to
explore the relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates [39–46].
The unemployment rate and consumer price (CPI) are also variables of concern.
Papapetrou [47] used the VAR model to explore the relationship between oil prices and
several macroeconomic variables in Greece, and found that changes in oil prices affect actual
economic activities and employment. Ewing and Thompson [48] used Hodrick–Prescott
and Baxter–King filters, and a full-sample asymmetric Christiano–Fitzgerald band-pass
filter, to study the cyclical linkage between crude oil prices and production, consumer prices,
unemployment, and stock prices. Guerrero-Escobar et al. [49] used 17 highly heterogeneous
countries as samples to study responses of industrial activity, inflation, interest rates, and
exchange rates to oil price shocks.
The impact of commodity prices on sustainable development has received increasing
attention in recent years, mainly energy prices. Borzuei et al. [8] used a threshold model
to study the impact of energy prices on Iran’s sustainable development under different
economic growth regimes, which is mainly achieved by promoting the use of renewable energy. Similarly, Li and Leung [50], Mukhtarov et al. [51], Karacan et al. [52], and
Mukhtarov et al. [53] confirmed the role of energy prices on renewable energy consumption,
and further affects the achievement of sustainable development goals. Umar et al. [54]
found that effective energy price policies can reduce carbon emissions and achieve SDGs;
Ma et al. [55], Sha et al. [56], Lee and Chong [57], Guo et al. [58], Malik et al. [59], and
Ike et al. [60] also confirmed the same point.
(3)

Commodity price forecast (Cluster #2, #7)

The drastic fluctuations in commodity prices have attracted many scholars to study
commodity price forecasting. When the prices of commodities are relatively stable, forecasting pays more attention to the general trend of prices and the overall price range, that is,
the first-order moment of prices. But when commodity prices fluctuate wildly, forecasting
needs to focus on the degree of price volatility, that is, the second-order moment of prices.
At present, there are mainly three methods to forecast commodity prices: (1) traditional econometric models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA),

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9536

13 of 22

autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), and generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroskedasticity model (GARCH); (2) machine learning methods, such as
support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and Random Forest
(RF); and (3) hybrid models combining the above two methods [61]. Traditional econometric models are based on strict linear assumptions and cannot introduce too many
independent variables. Machine learning methods, because they can effectively distinguish
random factors and capture hidden nonlinear characteristics that traditional econometric
models fail to do, can introduce more independent variables to maximize the control of
influencing factors.
For the traditional econometric models, some scholars have proposed improved
models for commodity price prediction. Herrera et al. [62] used high-frequency intra-day
realized volatility data to evaluate the relative prediction performance of various models,
including risk measurement models, the GARCH model, asymmetric GARCH model, splitintegral GARCH model, and Markov transformed GARCH model. Gupta and Wohar [63]
used a qualitative vector autoregressive to predict monthly returns of oil and stocks. Based
on the GARCH-X model, Gavriilidis et al. [64] used oil shocks of unknown sources as
exogenous variables to study their impact on the accuracy of spot price predictions.
For machine learning methods, scholars have attempted to decompose the sequence
through singular spectrum analysis (SSA) or empirical mode decomposition (EMD), predict
the decomposed sequence, and finally synthesize the prediction of the original sequence.
Yu and Wang [65] proposed a neural network ensemble learning paradigm based on EMD
for the forecast of world crude oil spot prices. Wang and Li [66] proposed SSA-NN, a neural
network prediction method based on SSA smoothing, and used four criteria to compare the
performance of this model with the basic neural network model. Their results show that
the SSA-NN model is superior to the basic neural network model in terms of performance
and accuracy to capture trend changes.
More scholars have focused on innovating on basic machine learning methods to
improve prediction accuracy. For example, Huang and Wu [61] used deep multi-core
learning (DMKL) to predict oil prices, verified that the model was superior to the traditional
model through real data, and significantly reduced prediction errors. Zhang and Na [67]
proposed an agricultural product price prediction model that combines fuzzy information
granulation, a mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA), and a support vector machine (SVM).
Their experiments proved that the model has a higher prediction accuracy and faster
calculation speed.
In the hybrid model, many models combine the advantages of measurement models
and machine learning to improve prediction accuracy. Zhang et al. [68] proposed the EEMD–
PSO–LSSVM–GARCH hybrid model to predict oil prices. Kristjanpoller and Minutolo [69]
used the ANN-GARCH model to predict oil spot and future prices, and successfully
improved that prediction model in terms of volatility and spot prices.
(4)

Financialization of commodities (Cluster #0)

As a foundational study on the relationship between commodity prices and financial
markets, Sadorsky [70] adopted the VAR model that incorporated monthly data from
January 1947 to April 1996 in the United States. It was found that the shocks of oil prices
would significantly affect the actual returns of stocks, and this effect was more pronounced
in 1986. Afterward, scholars have chosen various research objects and different time
periods to analyze the impact of commodity price changes on stock price changes or stock
returns [47,71–77].
The 2006–2008 food crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis caused violent fluctuations in commodity prices. This led the academic community to conclude that basic supply
and demand factors alone could not explain drastic changes in prices in a short period
of time, sensing some of the change could be attributed to financial factors, such as the
financialization of commodities, that is, significant index investment flows into commodity
markets. Morana [78] found that since 2000, financial shocks have played an important role
in boosting oil prices, and this effect has become more pronounced after 2008. Tilton [79]

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9536

studied the impact of investor demand on commodity spot prices and predicted that, if the
futures market is strong, a surge in investor demand will increase the price of the futures
market and directly affect spot market price. However, when the futures market is relatively
weak, investor behavior would have little impact on spot prices. The financialization of
commodity markets has also resulted in excessive linkages between commodity prices [80].
It can be seen that the research methods of these hot spots are constantly changing,
which is mainly attributed to the arrival of the era of big data, the rapid development
of machine learning for big data analysis, and the changes in the operation of the world
economy. The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of big data mean that the research data
can be full samples or close to full samples, which makes the obtained information more
valuable than traditional information; it also makes timely data analysis and prediction
possible. Compared with statistical parameter modeling, machine learning methods do
not need to give specific model assumptions or restrictions; rather, they learn and predict
by an algorithm according to the objective function, making it more common and flexible [81]. On the other hand, practice affects the direction of theoretical research to a great
extent. After the 2008 financial crisis, the degree of financialization of bulk commodities
continued to deepen, and they were more vulnerable to emergencies and other market
fluctuations. Therefore, scholars began to introduce the research methods of financial
markets into the bulk commodity market, and pay attention to the volatility and linkage of
bulk commodity prices.

4.2. Analysis of Landmark and Pivot Nodes
The landmark node and pivot node are the key objects in citation network analysis.
Identifying landmark points and turning points in the citation network can grasp the
evolution path of the discipline and yield important research results. The landmark node is
a nodule with a larger radius in the co-citation network and a higher citation frequency,
and signals this is a representative article in the development of the discipline. The pivot
node is the only connection point between the two clusters, which represents the shift of
research focus. The landmark node and pivot node are highlighted with purple circles in
the visualization results of the citation network (Figure 9).
The solid arrows in Figure 9 represent the pivot node of the citation network, and the
dashed arrow points to the landmark node of the citation network. Table 6 counts the pivot
nodes, landmark nodes, and highly cited articles in the citation network.
As shown in Figure 9 and Table 6, Lee et al. [86] and Mork et al. [87] are pivot nodes

4.3. Analysis of References with Citation Bursts
Burst monitoring is a powerful tool for exploring hot topics. Finding burst articles can
help to quickly identify emerging academic fields and research trends in a discipline such
as commodity prices.
In Figure 10, citation bursts identify that the stock market (Clusters #0), exchange rate
(Clusters #1), crude oil price forecasting (Clusters #2), oil price uncertainty (Clusters #3),
and agricultural commodity price (Clusters #4) are the hottest research sub-fields given the

5. Conclusions and Future New Research Direction
A large number of scholarly papers on commodity prices have emerged, and the
number of publications and citations has increased exponentially in recent years. This
study used bibliometrics to study 1671 articles in this field, ascertaining through statistical
analysis that articles in the field are mostly published in journals of energy economics,
such as Energy Economic and Energy Policy. Based on the number of publications, the
United States, China, and Australia ranked top in terms of research in this field. Half of
the top ten research institutions represented in the sampled papers are based in China,
in educational research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Hunan
University. These institutions formed a close collaborative relationship. Through analyzing
the core authors, as designated in our study, we found that Wang, Tiwari, Hammoudeh, and
Gupta have made leading contributions. Through the citation network and cluster analysis,
this study found that commodity price research hotspots emphasize four major aspects,
namely, influencing factors, impact on the macroeconomy, price prediction, and commodity
financialization. Based on our analyses, we propose two future research directions that are
most likely to unfold in the near future:
(1)

Increased attention to the impact of major events

The violent volatility of commodities is often impacted by major events, such as a
sharp increase in crude oil prices caused by the two oil crises in the 1970s, the overall decline
in commodity prices caused by the financial crisis in 2008, and the decline in commodity
prices and subsequent sharp increases in the prices of metal raw materials such as steel and
copper in 2019 caused by COVID-19.
Since economic uncertainty caused by the unpredictable onset of major financial,
weather-related, health-related, political, and economic events will directly lead to abnormal
fluctuations in commodity prices, which will seriously disrupt the supply and demand of
commodities [98], affect the operation of the macro-level economy, endanger enterprises,
and adversely affect the stability and sustainable development of the country, research on
the impact of major events and related countermeasures is an important direction. Going
forward, such research in this direction needs to develop methodologies on the basis of
existing ones, so as to integrate theory and practice.
(2)

Method innovation and selection of commodity price forecasting

The prediction of commodity prices has long been a hot research topic and will
continue to be developed in the future. Forecasting methods have also developed from
traditional time series models to machine learning, and then to a combination of the two.
Many scholars have improved their forecasting methods and their accuracy based on new
theories and models.
In our subsequent research, the data sources will be extended to text, video, and
images; however, the most important thing is to carefully select predictor variables and
specify the economic significance of the predicted results. Forecasting needs to identifying
causality from data, being problem-oriented, starting from reality, rather than purely
data-driven, and be able to use the predicted results in practice.
In addition to predicting research trends, the prediction of breakpoints and turning
points also deserves scholarly attention. At present, scholars have performed change
point analysis and statistical inference, and have carried out a probabilistic simulation of
this mutation rule, in order to quickly identify and even predict the mutation point [99].
Successfully predicting the turning point can help stakeholders to identify and prevent
risks, and achieve sustainable economic development [100].
The research of the article has certain policy implications. Commodities have always
been an important material basis for people’s life and production. In recent years, the
drastic fluctuations in commodity prices have caused great trouble to the operation of the
macro-economy, the sustainable development of the industry, and the normal production
of enterprises. Therefore, we must pay close attention to changes in commodity prices,
establish corresponding forecasting and early warning mechanisms, and try to avoid their

adverse effects on the economy as much as possible. Taking China as an example, based
on the current cooperation network, we can establish commodity research centers with
several major research institutions as the core (Chinese Academy of Sciences, University
of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen University, and Beihang University), carry out
relevant research, and develop corresponding prediction and early warning systems; thus,
this will provide a protective barrier for the macroeconomy.
